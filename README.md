# LOL Dashboard

This tool retrieves all your game data and displays it, helping you to understand yourself as a summoner.
You are the common factor in all your games, so it helps you to understand how you play.

## Description

At first, I just wanted to know the rank of my lane opponents. Then, I messed up and ended up creating this tool.
This tool queries the RIOT API to retrieve information about you, your games and your opponents. 
This data is then processed and saved in a local database before finally being displayed in a web browser.
You can see which ELO your lane opponents had, which champions you played the most, how many pings you used, which matchup suits you best and your metrics against any rank. There will be many more features to come.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

* Git (needed to clone the repository and manage versions)
* Docker (needed to run the dashboard)

> If you are using Windows or macOS, you will need to download Docker Desktop and activate WSL on Windows.

### RIOT API key

In order to use this software and access the RIOT API, you will require a key. To do so, you need to create a RIOT developer account linked to your RIOT account via this [link](https://developer.riotgames.com/). Then, click 'Regenerate API key' to generate a valid key.

> Be careful, as a valid key only lasts for 24 hours. Any time you want to reuse the RIOT API (to update the database), you will need to regenerate a new key.

### Installation

To install this League of Legends dashboard, simply clone this repository.

### Executing program

To run the software, simply run the following commands:  
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The dashboard is then available at http://localhost:5000/.
